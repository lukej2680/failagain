This was my third year of participating in the NCL Fall Season. Unfortunately I was not able to spend a siginificant amount of time on the challanges due to an increased work load and several projects being due that weekend however I still found time to knock out some challanges. There were plenty of interesting ones like always and I had fun solving them!

Below are links to the blog posts of challanges I completed organized into the 9 domains.
