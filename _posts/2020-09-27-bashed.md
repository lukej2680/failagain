  Bashed is an easy retired linux box on HTB. This machine tested your enumeration skills in order to first find the /dev terminal and then be able to exploit 
  the vulnerable sudo permissions and then a cron job running on the machine.

As with all test's I start with my initial nmap scans.

Port 80 is the only port open so the first thing I like to do is run a gobuster scan to see what web directories it can quickly find.

Here there are several interesting directories but the one I'm interested in is /dev.\
Navigating to the page I find a php page running a bash terminal. Poking around I find two users on this machine, arrexel and scriptmanager. But the more interesting find is after running;
<p class="message">$ sudo -l</p>
It seems the user www-data can run all commands as scriptmanager. This seems like a good road to go down since a user named scriptmanager I'd expect to have some control over running scripts which could lead to reverse shells.

But to start I tried switching to the user in the phpbash terminal however phpbash seems to be lacking alot of functionality. Therefore I used a python command to send a shell back to my listener in order to get a full bash shell as www-data. I use [Pentest Monkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) for all my reverse shell needs.

Now that we have a fully functional bash shell I sudo into the script manager user.

From here I move into the /scripts directory and discover two files, test.py and test.txt\
Looking at the contents of both it seems to be running a script writing "testing 123!" to the text file.\
Now this was just a hunch but I figured it was likely the command was being run as root. To test this I append the python reverse shell script to the test.py and set up a netcat listener.

As I suspected, I few minutes later I recieved a root shell back from the machine.
