title: Target Building

<p class="message">
  This challange asked me to answer questions relating to an image of an unknown building.
  I forgot to take screen capture of validating the answers but will do my best to describe the questions and answers.
</p>

**Q1: Find the date and time the picture was taken**\
To do this I downloaded the picture and used Mac's inspector tool to access the image metadata.\
Under TIFF I found the date and time the picture was taken.

**Q2: Who took the photo**\
Using the same tool the answer was in the TIFF.

**Q3: Street address of the building in the picture**\
At first I assumed this was going to be an easy question as the photographer left an image description of "Taken by Elm St & Cortland St". 
However after numerous attempts to find a Elm and Cortland St that were close together I was unsuccesful in answering this question.
