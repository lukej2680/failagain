  This challange asked me to find flags on a linux machine.
</p>

**Flag 1**\
This was in the home directory and I could simply cat the file.

**Flag 2**\
This was revealed after using ls -la showing me it ws moved to the root directory.

**Flag 3**\
This  flag was in the /var/mail/ directory.

**Flag 4**\
This flag was in my $PATH. At first I manually checked each location until I found the flag.
Then I realized it was in my $PATH so I could have simply just run it from anywhere.

**Flag 5**\
I didn't solve this one but the flag was hidden in the /var/log directory where my user had execute 
priveleges on but not read/write. Now this is unusual for a driectory becuase I can still enter 
the directory and access files inside but I cant see them. One strategy to go about doing this is 
try moving the flag from the locked directory to one we can read.

I however did not attempt this problem.
