  This challange asked me to crack several passwords that correlate with the rockyou breach.
</p>

First I needed to identify the hasing algorithm used on the passwords. To do this I used hash-identifier 
which comes pre-installed on kali.

Hash-identifier ID'd the hashes as being md5 so I used an online tool, which uses the rockyou list
as one of it's wordlists, to brute force the passwords.
