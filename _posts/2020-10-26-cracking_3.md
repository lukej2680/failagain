title: Cracking 3
---

<p class="message">
  This challange asked me to crack 3 passwords that were in the format "SKY-ICYY-" followed by 4 digits.
</p>

Knowing the format the cracked passwords would be in made this challenge easy. To start I wrote a 
python script to create all posible passwords.

Then I used a bash loop to hash each possible password and send to a hashes file.

Lastly I used grep to locate the correct hash.

Now after doing this I realized that I had removed the original password from the hash. Therefore
I ended up using grep -n to get the line number then using sed -n to locate the line number in
the passwords file

Doing this for each password yeilded the correct passwords.
