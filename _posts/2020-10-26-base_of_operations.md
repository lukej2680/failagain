  This challange asked me to find the location of a hacker group given three coordinates.
  I was unable to solve this problem but wanted to record it anyway.

Given this set of three coordinates I plotted them on google earth and when taking the third parameter (4345, 1337, 4705) as a radius in kilometers they
all seemed to connect at some point in South Korea. I was unable to figure out the exact location however and did not complete this challenge.
