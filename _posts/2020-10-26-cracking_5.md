<p class="message">
  This challange asked me to crack given passwords.
  I was unable to solve every password but will give my thought process for how to solve them.

Throwing these into crackstation immedietly yeilds three passwords from common wordlists.

The others were not in the wordlists the site uses, however by examining the passwords we did 
crack we can see that the passwords start with a cartoon charater \[firstname] \[lastname\] plus 
numbers or special characters. To solve this we'd have to create a custom wordlist and create the 
hashes before cross referencing like I did in [Cracking 3](https://lukej2680.github.io/2020/10/26/cracking_3/).
