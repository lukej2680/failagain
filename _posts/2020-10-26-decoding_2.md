  This challange asked me to decrypt an encrypted message.

Looking at the jumble of letters I initially thought it could be some kind of shift cipher. A type encryption that replaces letters with other letters or characters depending on the encryption formula.
I started by brute forcing the encrypted message against the Ceaser Cipher.

I was correct and both messages were encrypted using a ceaser cipher.
