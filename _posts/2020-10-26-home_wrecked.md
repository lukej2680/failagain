  This challange asked me to analyze a log file and answer various questions. 
</p>

**Q1**\
Reading through the first several lines of the log makes it obvious that the log home assistant was the application creating the logs.

**Q2**\
In order to find how many components generated logs I cut the file at the " " character and selected the feild containing the components name. 
I then piped the result into the sort then uniq command and counted the components left over.

**Q3**\
Using the same command as above I simply changed the feild from 5 to 4 in order to get the threads feild instead of components.

**Q4**\
Here I had to search for errors generated by the MainThread. 
This is easy enough by using grep twice on "MainThread" then "ERROR" and counting the outputted lines.

**Q5**\
This question asks for the error type of the internal python error.
To find this used cat -n on the file to display the line numbers and piped the input into a grep command searching for __init__.
The command returned one line at line number 291.
Going to that line in the log and looking at the lines before and after shows the internal error was a value error.

**Q6**\
Since I had to look for an email I started by grepping the file fop the "@" character.
Turns out there is only one email in the log so it has to be the compromised email.

**Q7**\
Grep the file for "mysensors" immedietly reveals the ip address of the sensors gateway.
