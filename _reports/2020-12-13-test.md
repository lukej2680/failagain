  Optimum was running a vulnerable file sharing server that was exloited using a remote code execution script. Once on the host system was gained by using the 
  kernel exploit MS16-098.

I used nmap to do initial port discovery.

The only port open on the host is port 80 http. There seems to be a HttpFileServer running so I'll verify this by visiting the page in the web browser.

First thing I like to look for is any known vulnerabilities if there is any kind of file sharing system running. Using searschploit I'll look for just that.

Immediately I see there are several vulnerabilities listed. Looking at the ones available, Remote Code Execution seems to be well documented so I'll try that 
out first. 

Reading through the source code I see the script is using the %00{.+"<command>".} characters as input for the search parameter to run the command enclosed. The 
script takes advantage of this by reaching out to my host to grab a copy of nc.exe and then using netcat to create a connection back to my machine.
